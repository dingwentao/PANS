# PANS
PANS is a parallel implementation of the Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) compression algorithm. It supports asymmetric compression and decompression across different hardware architectures, enabling flexible deployment based on system requirements. Specifically, it allows:
- Parallel compression on NVIDIA/AMD GPUs using [dietGPU](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dietgpu/), with parallel decompression on multi-core CPUs.
- Parallel compression on multi-core CPUs using PANS, with parallel decompression on NVIDIA GPUs via [dietGPU](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dietgpu/).
